# January 28th Meeting: Scrum Ceremony M1

**Attendees:**
* Brady
* Anjana
* Grayson
* Fabiha

**Key Discussion Points:**
Effective Teamwork Examples:
* Team was well co-ordinated
* Quick response time/activity
* Independent project tasks (this will not be the case always)

Ineffective Teamwork Examples:
* Grayson does not prefer calendar invites (didn't really impact milestone though)
* Delegate tasks as much as we can at the very start - otherwise people will do more than needed
* Project was done all in the back half (mostly)

Key Lessons:
* Clear and consistent communicating makes everything simple
* Peer Review is great
* Show up to Labs in future

**Action Items:**
* Anjana/Fabiha want to pick up action items that pop up next time
* For next time, complete milestone in "checkpoints", rather than all in one time
